==========================
Taskfile Contrib Directory
==========================

This folder contains, or will contain, extensions or other
user-submitted enhancements to Taskfile. Intentionally, the "core"
taskfile is to be stable and provide only basic functionality. Most
enhancements are possible by adding a script or interface in this folder.

If you add files to this directory, please note them in this README,
and include the name of the extension (i.e. file name,) who's
responsible for the contribution/maintenance (i.e. you,) and a brief
explanation of it's function. All operational and functional
documentation should be located in the docs. While documentation
contributions are welcome, feel free to add files to ``contrib/`` that
you do not document.
