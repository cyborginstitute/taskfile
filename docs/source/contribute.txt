Contribute to Taskfile
======================

Source Code
-----------

Taskfile source code is available from the following git hosting
providers:

- `taskfile git repository <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=taskfile.git>`_
  (Cyborg Institute.)
- `taskfile on Github <https://github.com/cyborginstitute/taskfile/>`_

Feel free to clone or fork at your leisure. Issue a pull request on
GitHub or send me an email/IM/IRC message if you want to send a patch,
or would like me to pull from another repository changes back into
"maineline." Feel free to suggest changes to either the code or the
documentation.

Contrib
-------

The ``contrib/`` directory in the source tree is for enhancements and
extensions to Taskfile. While the core makefiles are (and should be)
basic and unadorned for easy use, customization, and compatibility,
all submissions to ``contrib/`` are totally appropriate no matter how
specialized.

Bugs/Issues
-----------

Use the `taskfile issue tracker <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/taskfile/issues>`_
(on GitHub) to browse current bugs/issues/questions, or `open a new
issue <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/taskfile/issues/new>`_.

Feel free to send me an email if you want to log an issue, but don't
want to fuss with the bug tracker yourself (yet.)
