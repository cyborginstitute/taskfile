   tasklist
      The output of the Taskfile build process. The
      :target:`$(OUTPUT)` generates this file in the default build.

   variable
      The values that configure the machine and environmental specific
      operation of Taskfile. Full documentation is available in the
      :ref:`variables section of the internals reference <taskfile-variables>`.

   target
      In Make terminology a (build) target refers to the output
      generated according to the process defined by the makefile.

   future list
      A :term:`tasklist` filtered from the primary :target:`$(OUTPUT)`
      according to the :var:`FUTURE_FILTER`. Use to segregate
      non-actionable tasks that are beyond the current horizon, or in
      a dependent or frozen state.

   work list
      A :term:`tasklist` filtered from the primary :target:`$(OUTPUT)`
      according to the :var:`WORK_FILTER` (typically based on
      filename.)  Used to segregate non-actionable tasks or different
      spheres of work from each other.

   aggregation
      The process of consolidating information or data from a wide
      number of input sources into a single manageable output.

   keyword
      A string that you can use to identify a task item in a plain
      text file. Taskfile's default configuration assumes
      that keywords are strings of all-capital letters at the
      beginning of a line.

   flow
      In Taskfile operation, most source files are normal files that
      contain content and notes, as well as potential actionable task
      items. The flow file, is an exception, and operates as a scratch
      space for ad hoc tasks and actionable items that don't merit
      their own file, or for situations when you need to capture a
      large number of notes and tasks at once.
