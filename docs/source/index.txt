=============================

Taskfile is aggregates task information from text files using GNU
Make. Taskfile supports task tracking for a diverse collection of
workflows and tools.

Overview
--------

Taskfile, using GNU Make, compiles a tasklist from one or more
directories of files, using keywords (i.e. "``TODO``", "``FIXME``",
"``FROZEN``") to identify tasks and then generate a task
list. Basically, you focus on your own work, create tasks as you need
to, and run "``make``" every now and then. While
the approach is exceedingly simple, there are a number of practical
advantages that this approach provides:

- Task planning can transpire in-parallel with actual work on code or
  writing, without needing to switch to a task management systems.

- Complete interoperation with number of existing tools and systems,
  including:

  - Ikiwki
  - Sphinx
  - Git
  - File systems and text files.
  - Emacs' markdown mode, occur, and deft.
  - Pretty much anything else you want.

- Using GNU Make, makes it possible for the aggregation operation to
  be *very* efficient and robust, so you can use it against large
  collections of files.

- The implementation of Taskfile is nearly trivial. Dozens of
  make/shell lines do everything that you need, so it's easy to
  improve, extend, and tweak how the system works.

In truth this "project," if I may be so bold, is more about the text
and documentation that surrounds the code than the other way
around. Thus, consider this documentation set a primmer on creating
your own Taskfile-based system.
