Source Code
-----------

Taskfile source code is available from the following git hosting
providers:

- `taskfile git repository <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=taskfile.git>`_
  (Cyborg Institute.)
- `taskfile on Github <https://github.com/cyborginstitute/taskfile/>`_

Feel free to clone or fork at your leisure. Issue a pull request on
GitHub or send me an email/IM/IRC message if you want to send a patch,
or would like me to pull from another repository changes back into
"maineline." Feel free to suggest changes to either the code or the
documentation.

Bugs/Issues
-----------

Use the `taskfile issue tracker <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/taskfile/issues>`_
(on GitHub) to browse current bugs/issues/questions, or `open a new
issue <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/taskfile/issues/new>`_.

Feel free to send me an email if you want to log an issue, but don't
want to fuss with the bug tracker yourself (yet.)
